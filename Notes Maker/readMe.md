so basically we would have a container with "ids" and then when clicked we would
redirect the note to a new page where we would also add event listeners ( i assume we call a
function which does this ) and then yeah we just keep updating based upon the
events ;

and when we redirect back we would first invoke addlisteners() and also bring back notes from
localStorage ;
