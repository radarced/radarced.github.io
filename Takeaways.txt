add attributes to your elements as every element is an object and you can access that using 
JAVASCRIPT!;
make 10 thousand globals BUT! make them as object JAVASCRIPT and objects are one!;
stop enforcing so much procedural programming let yourself make maps to find such conditions
use JAVASCRIPT the way its intended!;
so once u start building bigger apps youll run into state problems more than anything;
so get really good at fsm now and it would save you alot of state smuggling (if thisthen that if NOT this that oh wait if that is then it changes this then THIS and so on)
its going to get really annoying so ^^;

flexbox is a way to control the alignmnet of children nodes + control their main-axis(i think) factor on how much theyd grow shrink , initial size;
flex-grow : how much they would grow relative to the free space in the container;
flex-shrink : how much they would shrink relative to the other elements flex-shrink factor AFTER all flex-items have taken their places ( fully expanded );
flex-basis  : initial size of the flex-items;
align-items : align vertically if row so Cross-axis;
justify-content : align items on the main-axis;
